Message me before ordering

I'm developer of timegrid, an application made on Laravel 5.x for online appointments.

If you are beginning your first project on Laravel and you need help, I can assist you to refactor and optimize your code so you keep your codebase clean and elegant.

  * Keep your naming consistent
  * Comply with coding style standards
  * Reduce duplicated code
  * Remove obsolete lines
  * Reduce bug risk

Important:

  * I will need you to provide codebase access or at least the piece you want to optimize in advance.
  * I will analize one Class and use http://laravel.io/bin to exchange the code changes.
